\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Seismic inversion and imaging are adjoint-based optimization problems that processes up to terabytes of data, regularly exceeding the memory
capacity of available computers. Data compression is an effective strategy to
reduce this memory requirement by a certain factor, particularly if some loss in
accuracy is acceptable. A popular alternative is checkpointing, where data is
stored at selected points in time, and values at other times are recomputed as
needed from the last stored state.  This allows arbitrarily large adjoint
computations with limited memory, at the cost of additional recomputations.

In this paper we combine compression and checkpointing for the first
time to compute a realistic seismic inversion. The combination of
checkpointing and compression allows
larger adjoint computations compared to using only compression, and
reduces the recomputation overhead significantly compared to using only checkpointing.
